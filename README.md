## Real-Time Social Media Sentiment Analysis
## Project Overview

This project focuses on real-time sentiment analysis of trending topics or hashtags on Twitter. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project extracts and analyzes public sentiment to determine whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. It includes sentiment comparison between different years (e.g., 2023 and 2024), allowing for a deeper understanding of how opinions evolve over time.

## Features

Real-Time Sentiment Scoring: Analyzes live tweets and classifies them as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment of the text.

Trending Hashtag Analysis: Provides insights into the most discussed topics and their emotional charge.

Sentiment Comparison (2023 vs. 2024): Compares public sentiment across years to see how opinions shift over time.
## Tech Stack

Python: Core language used for data collection, sentiment analysis, and integration with visualization tools.

Tweepy: A Python library for interacting with the Twitter API and fetching real-time tweets.

nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): Used for performing sentiment analysis through NLP techniques.

Power BI/Tableau: (Optional) Visualization tools used to display sentiment trends, comparisons, and insights.

Matplotlib: Python's data visualization library used for creating charts and plots.
## Project Setup

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-social-media-sentiment-analysis.git
cd real-time-social-media-sentiment-analysis

2. Install the Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary Python packages by running:

pip install tweepy
pip install nltk
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy

3. Set Up Twitter API
To fetch tweets, you'll need to create a Twitter Developer account and get your API keys:

Go to Twitter Developer Portal and create an app.
Generate your API Key, API Secret Key, Access Token, and Access Token Secret.
Replace the placeholders in the script with your credentials:
python
Copy code
API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
API_SECRET_KEY = 'your_api_secret_key'
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your_access_token'
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'your_access_token_secret'

4. Run the Sentiment Analysis
Run the Python script to fetch real-time tweets and perform sentiment analysis:

5. Visualize Results
The sentiment analysis results will be printed as text, displaying the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral tweets. You can also visualize the sentiment distribution using the generated pie charts.




## Tools and Technologies

Python: Core programming language used for data handling, analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation.
Plotly Express: Used for creating interactive line charts and bar graphs to visualize the time-series data.
Git and GitHub: Version control system used to track changes, collaborate, and share the project on GitHub.
## Workflow

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and columns containing the station names and flood event counts are cleaned and transformed into a long format suitable for analysis.
The 'Year' column is extracted from the data and converted into a usable integer format, making it easy to filter data for specific time ranges (e.g., 1990 to 2024).
Data Filtering:

The user is prompted to enter the station name and year range for analysis. Based on this input, the dataset is filtered to show flooding data for the selected region and time period.
Interactive Visualizations:

Using Plotly Express, dynamic line plots are created for each station showing the number of high tide flooding events per year. The visualizations allow users to explore the trends and compare data across stations.
